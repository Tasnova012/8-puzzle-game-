# 8-puzzle-game
8 puzzle game in python code


#Introduction 
8-Puzzle is an interesting game which requires a player to move blocks one at a time to solve a picture or a particular pattern. In this article I will be showing you how to write an intelligent program that could solve 8-Puzzle automatically using the A* algorithm using Python and PyGame. Instead of a picture, we will use a pattern of numbers as shown in the figure, that is the final state. If you need to go through the A* algorithm theory or 8-Puzzle.


#Background
Artificial Intelligence is the science of making a machine intelligent. To make a machine intelligent we need some way of processing the data and environment. Everything in AI follows an algorithm. At the basic level, there are simple but impressive algorithms. A* algorithm is one of the basic algorithms of AI. A* employs a heuristic function to find the solution to a problem. For more info on AI and its algorithms, get the book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach".
